# Digits-Classification-CNN

The project involves the exploration and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a widely used dataset containing handwritten digits. The code initially loads the dataset, preprocesses the images, and then builds a CNN model with convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. The model is trained on the training set, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. The training process involves optimizing the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function. Additionally, there is an attempt to visualize a few images from the dataset. The project extends to making predictions on a new image using the trained model, demonstrating its ability to generalize beyond the training data. Challenges encountered include issues with image loading and reshaping, which were addressed through the use of OpenCV and proper preprocessing techniques. The project showcases a practical application of deep learning in image classification and serves as a foundation for further exploration and refinement of neural network models
